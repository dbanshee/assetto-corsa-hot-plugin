[python] collection of AC development tools


When I made the DeltaBar plugin, I wanted to be able to iterate fast.

Having to relaunch an AC session to reload the plugin
after each development cycle is excruciatingly slow.

Also, I am not a Windows developer, and am more comfortable with a Linux CLI.

So, I made a "hot reload" system.

I can develop on my Linux box, hit "send", and suddenly the new plugin
version is running within an AC session.  An error or a slight change?
Just "send" again and now it's updated.  I can read any exceptions
on the linux side, and also pop open an interactive console to test
the AC API with a REPL, while AC is running.

There's a working example at
https://github.com/jamessanford/assetto-corsa-hot-plugin/

Just replace 'hot_app' and 'HotApp' to make it your own.



I also noticed that some other developers have made their own set of tools.

Here is what I know of:

View all AC API values inside the sim:

A stubbed out version of ac/acsys so you can smoke test your code:

An offline mode for ac/acsys that appears to record the calls in online mode
and replay valid return values when offline:
  ptracker ACSIM 'acsim.py' 'app_skeleton'
